# Pong-The-Game
This was my first game in Python, but I'm very proud of it! Enjoy! Its still in development!!

This is a pong based game, a classic! There will be updates with new features, such like levels, difficulty settings and levels, a coin system and upgrades and what i can think of it later! This basically works with the Python programming language, so you will have to run the main source code file in the terminal with Python 3 or run it inside a Python IDE to play the game.

The main file containing the source code uses this files to play the game, so please put them in the same folder where the files can be together!

Its my first game so if there are any bugs or ideas for updates let me know! Its still in development!

This basically works with the Python programming language and the game itself runs with the help of Pygame, a python gaming library, so you will have to run the main source code file in the terminal with Python 3 installed on the system or run it inside a Python IDE to play the game, I recommend running it with the free version of Pycharm (a Python IDE), which is available online!
